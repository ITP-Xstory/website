Skeletron is a system that predicts joints and human skeleton position in 3d from real-time video taken by any (cheap) RGB camera, such as a webcam. The system sends the data about the position of the human body to Unity, a 3D game development engine, to allow engineers, artists, and creative technologists to use it to develop digital experiences.
